Throughout my research career, I quit my job twice.  
The first time because I knew in March that I needed to be home with my family for July and August, so I had to start looking for my next job in March to make sure I still had a job to do in September.Meanwhile I also want to purse a Phd,but I do not have a master degree. Despite quit, I still managed to work until articles were submitted.   
For the second time, I quit for many reasons. The most important reason is that two weeks before I started my job, I always thought that I would do work related to evolution. I was very interested in such pure dry lab content, and this kind of evolution-related content could also be applied to cancer cell in medicine, which was in line with my future development direction. However, after my actual work, I found myself doing a process analysis of bacteria, which is not growth for me, but will wear away my experience and skills. Therefore, after 3 weeks of thinking, I chose to quit with the teacher. Then, after the teacher thought for a while, he agreed to my resignation, so now I am looking for a new job.
